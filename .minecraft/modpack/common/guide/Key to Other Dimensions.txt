§3§lTeleportation to Greckon, Runador and Lunalus

Greckon and Runador portals can be found in the Mysterium dimension on the Portal Tower structure. You also need to buy Realm Travel Ticket from the Portal Master, which stands near the portals.

Killing Terrestrial in the Overworld will create a portal structure that leads to Lunalus. Terrestrial is a very rare mob that spawns during Full Moon Event in the Overworld.
