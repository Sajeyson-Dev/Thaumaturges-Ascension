§3Ability:
- Dealing true damage.

§3Getting Vulcanism XP:
- When the player is attacked, with a chance, the Vulcanism icon may appear for a short time right next to the rage bar. That means the player can use Vulcane and deal a certain amount of true damage to the last attacker. Vulcane's damage depends on the skill level.

§3A few notes: 
- §2§oTo obtain Vulcane you need to visit Immortalis dimension.
- §2§oTrue damage means that damage cannot be reduced by armor or any other way.
